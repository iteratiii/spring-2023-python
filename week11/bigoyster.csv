New York Harbor,"Oysters spend their lives—a dozen years if we left them alone, but only three or four because we don’t—sucking in seawater, extracting nutrients, and pumping it out again. There used to be enough oysters in New York Harbor to process all the water there. And perhaps this is also why oysters taste like eating the sea."
New York Harbor,The oyster was New Yorkers’ link to the sea.
Pearl Street,"We know that the Lenape ate copious quantities of oysters because oyster shells last a very long time and they left behind tremendous piles of them. These piles, containing thousands of shells, have been found throughout the New York City area. Archaeologists call them shell middens. The most common marker of a pre-European settlement anywhere in the area of the mouth of the Hudson are these piles of oyster shells, sometimes as much as four feet deep, sometimes buried in the ground, sometimes piled high. The early-seventeenth-century Dutch were the first to note the shell middens. One such mountain of oyster shells gave Pearl Street, originally on the waterfront in lower Manhattan, its name."
Kalck Pond,"They took these shells and placed them in fields, where the lime would neutralize acid soil, a technique known at the time as “sweetening” the soil. They also burned shells to render lime paste to be used in colonial construction."
Hudson River,"About thirty miles north of Manhattan, around the town of Peekskill, the Hudson veers to the northwest, which causes tidewaters to move toward the eastern bank, and any oyster eggs deposited in the salt water would drift there. Shellfish beds and therefore middens were clustered on that bank."
Dobbs Ferry,"The native shell beds of the New York area and their residents, Crassostrea virginica, are believed to have first appeared about 10,000 B.C. The oldest Atlantic shell midden, in Dobbs Ferry, has been carbon-dated to about 6950 B.C. give or take a hundred years—long before the arrival of the Lenape three thousand years ago. This marks the oldest evidence of humans ever found in the Hudson Valley."
Manhattan,"The deeper archaeologists dig in a midden, the larger the shells they find. The large bottom shells are older than the smaller top ones, which shows that, contrary to popular belief, even before Europeans arrived, people were overharvesting oysters. On the bottom the very largest ones, described as “giant oysters,” measure eight to ten inches. This suggests that Dutch reports of foot-long oysters were only slightly exaggerated."
New York,"A Crassostrea virginica, like fish and unlike humans, if not taken by man or other predators, and not killed by disease, will grow larger every year of their twelve to fifteen year lives. Factors such as salinity and water temperature determine the speed of growth. But the greatest factor in the size of an oyster is age: how long it has been left to grow in its bed before being harvested. "
Manhattan,"Fine, tall-grassed meadows, the woodlands, fields of wildflowers, the streams, the variety of the cooing and clattering birds, the deliciousness of the native nuts, wild cherries, currants, gooseberries, hazelnuts, apples and pears, and especially strawberries. People who lived by the water could not sleep at night because of the clattering of swans and other waterfowl. The rivers and streams had so many fish—striped bass, sturgeon, shad, drum fish, carp, perch, pike, and trout—that they could be yanked out of the water by hand."
New York Harbor,"The harbor was crowded with bass, cod, weakfish, herring, mackerel, blackfish, as well as frolicking, diving mammals—whales, porpoises, and seals. Bears, wolves, beavers, foxes, raccoons, otters, elk, deer, and even a few “lion,” which may have been panthers or mountain lions, lived in the area."
New York City,"It is not possible to describe how this bay swarms with fish, both large and small, whales, tunnies, and porpoises, whole schools of innumerable other fish, which the eagles and other birds of prey swiftly seize in their talons when the fish comes to the surface."
Lower Manhattan,"A teaming wetland of grassy marshes, which the Mohawk called Gänóno, reedy place, filled with birds and marine life."
Rivington Street,A salty wetland extended to what is today Rivington Street.
Lower Manhattan,In times of heavy rains these streams swelled and cut the island of Manhattan in two.
Atlantic coast,"All of the oysters in North America, from Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, up the coast of Florida, in the Chesapeake Bay, in New York City, Long Island, Long Island Sound, Wellfleet, Maine, Nova Scotia, and even beyond, are biologically identical. They are all the same family, genus, and species—Ostreidae Crassostrea virginica. The fact that all these Crassostrea virginicas along the Atlantic coast vary in size, shape, color, and taste is simply proof that with oysters, as with wine, the deciding factor is not the variety, but where it is planted and how it is grown. Water temperature is critical. Oysters grow faster in warm water, although the length of time they are left to grow is also important. Colder water tends to produce oysters that fans call more flavorful and detractors call too strong. Northerners tend to find Southern oysters large and bland and Southerners find Northern oysters small and harsh. In addition to temperature, oysters are altered by many factors including the salinity of the water, the type of food available in the water, the structure of the seabed, and the degree of crowding."
New York Hudson estuary,"Crassostrea thrive in warm, brackish water in intertidal and subtidal areas along shorelines where there is fresh water flowing from rivers that are rich in organic matter."
New York Harbor,"Oysters under normal conditions feed continually, and between twenty and fifty gallons of seawater are moved through a single oyster’s gills every day. Assuming the water is in fairly good condition, oysters serve a natural function, filtering and cleaning the water. It has been found that a few oysters placed in a tank of algae- and phytoplankton-laden green water will make the water clear in only a few hours. The original oyster population of New York Harbor was capable of filtering all of the water in the harbor in a matter of days."
New York Harbor,"It took a remarkably long time, well into the nineteenth century in America, to understand that the best thing to do with oyster shells was not make wampum, burn them for lime, or use them for roadfill, but to dump them back into the oyster beds. This became clear with the study of oyster physiology. The mantle that sends out warnings to the oyster brain also creates the shell. It produces a first pearly layer of shell and throughout the animal’s life constantly creates new shells, each a little larger than the one before. That is why an oyster shell looks like many paper-thin layers pressed together. The oyster shell will conform to the surface it is next to, smooth if attached to a bottle, following the contours of a rock, even molding itself to the shape of a crab claw if attached to it."
New York Harbor,"Oysters need lime to grow, and no matter how rich the water is in nutrients, without the presence of lime growth cannot take place. Throwing the shells back into the water not only provides good material for seedlings looking for a surface to attach to, which has come to be known as cultch, but also enriches the growing environment of the water. The sea will break down the shell and the oyster will absorb the lime. The more lime that is available, the faster and thicker the shells will grow. The sooner an oyster has a thick shell, the more likely it is that it will survive its many enemies."
New Amsterdam,Hundreds of miles of natural oyster beds.
New York,New York was still an Eden where resources could be used with extravagance. Gowanus Bay in Brooklyn was particularly known for large oysters.
Gowanus Cove,"We found a good fire half way up the chimney of clear oak and hickory, of which they made not the least scruple in burning profusely. We let it penetrate thoroughly. There had already been thrown upon it to be roasted, a pailful of Guanes oysters, which are the best in the country. They are large and full, some of them not less than a foot in length."
Great South Bay,A huge natural oyster bed between Long Island and Fire Island.
Jamaica Bay,"Jamaica Bay, named not after the Caribbean island but from the Canarsee name Jameco, was rich in oysters, clams, and crabs, especially on the northern side, which is dotted with islands that appear only at low tide."
New York City,"The unused wharves, having seen no commerce, were covered with seaweed and barnacles."
Hudson River,"The Hudson River was particularly rich in both fresh- and saltwater species, including striped bass, shad, and sturgeon."
Hudson River,"The river is home to more than two hundred fish species—a stunning assortment of both fresh- and saltwater fish, like an aquarium that displays the wildlife of several lakes, a river, and the ocean in the same tank. Among the residents of the Hudson River are largemouth bass, herring, carp, white perch, yellow perch, menhaden, shiners, darters, sunfish, tomcod, and even some subtropical fish such as the mullet and the jack crevalle, which are more typical of Florida than of the Northeast. The Caribbean needlefish and pompano as well as mangrove snapper have been found in the lower Hudson. The lower half of the Hudson is a tidal estuary where typical river species such as trout and pike swim past ocean species including sea horses, dolphins, bluefish, shark, and an occasional intrepid whale. Two species of sturgeon that are classified endangered, striped bass and shad, despite man’s abuse, have stubbornly continued to return each spring through the Narrows and up the Hudson to spawn a new generation of seagoing fish in the river’s fresh waters."
Sandy Hook,"Bluefish are back, the striper are plentiful, and the sharks off of Sandy Hook are waiting for the water to get clean enough for their return."
Hudson River estuary,"Since more and more oysters are slowly turning up, they might conceivably someday cover most of the estuary’s shorelines again. "
Hudson River,"In the spring, the migratory fish return. Thousands of bumpy alligator-headed, primeval two-hundred-pound sturgeon; elegant silver-streaked striped bass, their stripes seemingly made for racing; and thick schools of radiant shad tear into the strong currents, while little baitfish, purposeless hangers-on caught up in all the exhilaration of the moment, struggle furiously along as best they can. They are all bumping shoulders, swatting tails, thousands and thousands of determined fish, putting their heads nose first into the same current, charging through the Narrows over to the oyster beds of Liberty and Ellis islands, while their sedentary partners, the oysters, wave their shells open and closed beneath them, pumping clean the water, the seething crowds above turning and racing toward Manhattan and the Hudson River, past the teeming and humming city, street by street to the picturesque upstate waters of their birth. Certainly anyone who could have seen that would have understood that the great and unnatural city was built at the site of a natural wonder, and that the lowly oysters working at the bottom were a treasure more precious than pearls."
