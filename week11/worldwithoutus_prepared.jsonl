{"prompt":"Central Park ->","completion":" what was mostly a swampy bog surrounded by poison oak and sumac.\n"}
{"prompt":"59th Street ->","completion":" the shoreline of the long, narrow lake that lay along what is now 59th Street, north of the Plaza Hotel, with its tidal outlet that meandered through salt marsh to the East River.\n"}
{"prompt":"Broadway ->","completion":" From the west, he can see a pair of streams entering the lake that drained the slope of Manhattan’s major ridgeline, a deer and mountain lion trail known today as Broadway.\n"}
{"prompt":"Manhattan ->","completion":" He’s identified more than 40 brooks and streams that traversed what was once a hilly, rocky island: in the Algonquin tongue of its first human occupants, the Lenni Lenape, Mannahatta referred to those now-vanished hills.\n"}
{"prompt":"Water Street ->","completion":" Whenever it rains hard, sewers clog with storm debris—the number of plastic garbage bags adrift in the world’s cities may truly exceed calculation—and the water, needing to go somewhere, plops down the nearest subway stairs. Add a nor’easter, and the surging Atlantic Ocean bangs against New York’s water table until, in places like Water Street in lower Manhattan or Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, it backs up right into the tunnels, shutting everything down until it subsides. Should the ocean continue to warm and rise even faster than the current inch per decade, at some point it simply won’t subside.\n"}
{"prompt":"Van Siclen Avenue ->","completion":" Shading his eyes with his white hard hat, Schuber peers down into a square pit beneath the Van Siclen Avenue station in Brooklyn, where each minute 650 gallons of natural groundwater gush from the bedrock. Gesturing over the roaring cascade, he indicates four submersible cast-iron pumps that take turns laboring against gravity to stay ahead. Such pumps run on electricity. When the power fails, things can get difficult very fast.\n"}
{"prompt":"PATH train tunnels ->","completion":" Had the Hudson River actually burst through the PATH train tunnels that connect New York’s subways to New Jersey, as was greatly feared, the pump train—and possibly much of the city—would simply have been overwhelmed.\n"}
{"prompt":"Lexington Avenue ->","completion":" Even if it weren’t raining, with subway pumps stilled, that would take no more than a couple of days, they estimate. At that point, water would start sluicing away soil under the pavement. Before long, streets start to crater. With no one unclogging sewers, some new watercourses form on the surface. Others appear suddenly as waterlogged subway ceilings collapse. Within 20 years, the water-soaked steel columns that support the street above the East Side’s 4, 5, and 6 trains corrode and buckle. As Lexington Avenue caves in, it becomes a river.\n"}
{"prompt":"Manhattan ->","completion":" Things will begin to fall apart during the first month of March after humans vacate Manhattan. Each March, temperatures normally flutter back and forth around 32°F as many as 40 times (presumably, climate change could push this back to February). Whenever it is, the repeated freezing and thawing make asphalt and cement split. When snow thaws, water seeps into these fresh cracks. When it freezes, the water expands, and cracks widen.\n"}
{"prompt":"Manhattan ->","completion":" As pavement separates, weeds like mustard, shamrock, and goosegrass blow in from Central Park and work their way down the new cracks, which widen further. In the current world, before they get too far, city maintenance usually shows up, kills the weeds, and fills the fissures. But in the post-people world, there’s no one left to continually patch New York. The weeds are followed by the city’s most prolific exotic species, the Chinese ailanthus tree. Even with 8 million people around, ailanthus—otherwise innocently known as the tree-of-heaven—are implacable invaders capable of rooting in tiny chinks in subway tunnels, unnoticed until their spreading leaf canopies start poking from sidewalk grates. With no one to yank their seedlings, within five years powerful ailanthus roots are heaving up sidewalks and wreaking havoc in sewers—which are already stressed by all the plastic bags and old newspaper mush that no one is clearing away. As soil long trapped beneath pavement gets exposed to sun and rain, other species jump in, and soon leaf litter adds to the rising piles of debris clogging the sewer grates.\n"}
{"prompt":"High Line ->","completion":" The early pioneer plants won’t even have to wait for the pavement to fall apart. Starting from the mulch collecting in gutters, a layer of soil will start forming atop New York’s sterile hard shell, and seedlings will sprout. With far less organic material available to it—just windblown dust and urban soot—precisely that has happened in an abandoned elevated iron bed of the New York Central Railroad on Manhattan’s West Side. Since trains stopped running there in 1980, the inevitable ailanthus trees have been joined by a thickening ground cover of onion grass and fuzzy lamb’s ear, accented by stands of goldenrod. In some places, the track emerges from the second stories of warehouses it once serviced into elevated lanes of wild crocuses, irises, evening primrose, asters, and Queen Anne’s lace. So many New Yorkers, glancing down from windows in Chelsea’s art district, were moved by the sight of this untended, flowering green ribbon, prophetically and swiftly laying claim to a dead slice of their city, that it was dubbed the High Line and officially designated a park.\n"}
{"prompt":"Central Park ->","completion":" But with no firemen to answer the call, a dry lightning strike that ignites a decade of dead branches and leaves piling up in Central Park will spread flames through the streets. Within two decades, lightning rods have begun to rust and snap, and roof fires leap among buildings, entering paneled offices filled with paper fuel. Gas lines ignite with a rush of flames that blows out windows. Rain and snow blow in, and soon even poured concrete floors are freezing, thawing, and starting to buckle. Burnt insulation and charred wood add nutrients to Manhattan’s growing soil cap. Native Virginia creeper and poison ivy claw at walls covered with lichens, which thrive in the absence of air pollution. Red-tailed hawks and peregrine falcons nest in increasingly skeletal high-rise structures.\n"}
{"prompt":"Manhattan ->","completion":" Within two centuries, colonizing trees will have substantially replaced pioneer weeds. Gutters buried under tons of leaf litter provide new, fertile ground for native oaks and maples from city parks. Arriving black locust and autumn olive shrubs fix nitrogen, allowing sunflowers, bluestem, and white snakeroot to move in along with apple trees, their seeds expelled by proliferating birds.\n"}
{"prompt":"New York Botanical Garden ->","completion":" A 40-acre tract of original, old-growth, virgin New York forest, never logged. Never cut, but mightily changed. Until only recently, it was known as the Hemlock Forest for its shady stands of that graceful conifer, but almost every hemlock here is now dead, slain by a Japanese insect smaller than the period at the end of this sentence, which arrived in New York in the mid-1980s. The oldest and biggest oaks, dating back to when this forest was British, are also crashing down, their vigor sapped by acid rain and heavy metals such as lead from automobile and factory fumes, which have soaked into the soil. It’s unlikely that they’ll come back, because most canopy trees here long ago stopped regenerating. Every resident native species now harbors its own pathogen: some fungus, insect, or disease that seizes the opportunity to ravish trees weakened by chemical onslaught. As if that weren’t enough, as the NYBG forest became an island of greenery surrounded by hundreds of square miles of gray urbanity, it became the primary refuge for Bronx squirrels. With natural predators gone and no hunting permitted, there’s nothing to stop them from devouring every acorn or hickory nut before it can germinate. Which they do.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hudson River wetlands ->","completion":" Communities of cattail, willow, and canary grass that fed and sheltered waterfowl and muskrats turned into solid curtains of purple, impenetrable even to wildlife. By the 21st century, purple loosestrife was at large even in Alaska, where panicked state ecologists fear it will fill entire marshes, driving out ducks, geese, terns, and swans.\n"}
{"prompt":"Washington Heights ->","completion":" Descendants of seed corn planted by Dominicans in parkway medians may eventually retrace their DNA back to the original Mexican teosinte, its cob barely bigger than a sprig of wheat.\n"}
{"prompt":"Greenwich Village ->","completion":" Grassy savannas, cleared repeatedly with fire by the Lenni Lenape for planting.\n"}
{"prompt":"Harlem ->","completion":" By flooding ancient Harlem fire pits to see what floats to the top, Mannahatta Project researchers have learned that the Lenni Lenape cultivated corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers. Much of the island was still as green and dense as the Białowiea Puszcza.\n"}
{"prompt":"George Washington Bridge ->","completion":" The annual miracle of baby peregrine falcons hatching high atop the George Washington’s towers, and at the sheer botanical audacity of grass, weeds, and ailanthus trees that defiantly bloom, far from topsoil, from metal niches suspended high above the water. The bridges are under a constant guerrilla assault by nature. Its arsenal and troops may seem ludicrously puny against steel-plated armor, but to ignore endless, ubiquitous bird droppings that can snag and sprout airborne seeds, and simultaneously dissolve paint, would be fatal. A primitive, but unrelenting foe whose ultimate strength is its ability to outlast its adversary. Ultimately, nature must win.\n"}
{"prompt":"Bayonne Bridge ->","completion":" At first, oxidation forms a coating on steel plate, twice as thick or more as the metal itself, which slows the pace of chemical attack. For steel to completely rust through and fall apart might take centuries, but it won’t be necessary to wait that long for New York’s bridges to start dropping. The reason is a metallic version of the freeze-thaw drama. Rather than crack like concrete, steel expands when it warms and contracts when it cools. So that steel bridges can actually get longer in summer, they need expansion joints. In winter, when they shrink, the space inside expansion joints opens wider, and stuff blows in. Wherever it does, there’s less room for the bridge to expand when things warm up. With no one painting bridges, joints fill not only with debris but also with rust, which swells to occupy far more space than the original metal. Come summer the bridge is going to get bigger whether you like it or not. If the expansion joint is clogged, it expands toward the weakest link—like where two different materials connect, like where four lanes of steel meet the concrete abutment. The concrete could crack where the beam is bolted to the pier. Or, after a few seasons, that bolt could shear off. Eventually, the beam could walk itself right off and fall.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hell Gate ->","completion":" They might hold for the next 1,000 years, although earthquakes rippling through one of several faults under the coastal plain could shorten that period.\n"}
{"prompt":"East River subway tunnels ->","completion":" They would probably do better than the 14 steel-lined, concrete subway tubes beneath the East River—one of which, leading to Brooklyn, dates back to horses and buggies. Should any of their sections separate, the Atlantic Ocean would rush in\n"}
{"prompt":"Birdges ->","completion":" The suspension and truss bridges that carry automobiles, however, will last only two or three centuries before their rivets and bolts fail and entire sections fall into the waiting waters. Until then, more coyotes follow the footsteps of the intrepid ones that managed to reach Central Park. Deer, bear, and finally wolves, which have reentered New England from Canada, arrive in turn.\n"}
{"prompt":"Grand Central ->","completion":" Older stone buildings such as Grand Central—especially with no more acid rain to pock their marble—will outlast every shiny modern box.\n"}
{"prompt":"Skyscrapers ->","completion":" By the time most of its bridges are gone, Manhattan’s newer buildings have also been ravaged, as wherever leaks reach their embedded steel reinforcing bars, they rust, expand, and burst the concrete that sheaths them. Ruins of high-rises echo the love song of frogs breeding in Manhattan’s reconstituted streams, now stocked with alewives and mussels dropped by seagulls.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hudson River ->","completion":" Herring and shad have returned to the Hudson.\n"}
{"prompt":"Manhattan shoreline ->","completion":" Rising water, tides, and salt corrosion have replaced the engineered shoreline, circling New York’s five boroughs with estuaries and small beaches.\n"}
{"prompt":"Central Park ->","completion":" With no dredging, Central Park’s ponds and reservoir have been reincarnated as marshes. Without natural grazers—unless horses used by hansom cabs and by park policemen managed to go feral and breed—Central Park’s grass is gone. A maturing forest is in its place, radiating down former streets and invading empty foundations. Coyotes, wolves, red foxes, and bobcats have brought squirrels back into balance with oak trees tough enough to outlast the lead we deposited, and after 500 years, even in a warming climate the oaks, beeches, and moisture-loving species such as ash dominate.\n"}
{"prompt":"Harlem River ->","completion":" Long before, the wild predators finished off the last descendants of pet dogs, but a wily population of feral house cats persists, feeding on starlings. With bridges finally down, tunnels flooded, and Manhattan truly an island again, moose and bears swim a widened Harlem river to feast on the berries that the Lenape once picked.\n"}
{"prompt":"Financial District ->","completion":" Amid the rubble of Manhattan financial institutions that literally collapsed for good, a few bank vaults stand; the money within, however worthless, is mildewed but safe.\n"}
{"prompt":"Metropolitan Museum ->","completion":" Not so the artwork stored in museum vaults, built more for climate control than strength. Without electricity, protection ceases; eventually museum roofs spring leaks, usually starting with their skylights, and their basements fill with standing water. Subjected to wild swings in humidity and temperature, everything in storage rooms is prey to mold, bacteria, and the voracious larvae of a notorious museum scourge, the black carpet beetle. As they spread to other floors, fungi discolor and dissolve paintings in the Metropolitan beyond recognition. Ceramics, however, are doing fine, since they’re chemically similar to fossils. Unless something falls on them first, they await reburial for the next archaeologist to dig them up. Corrosion has thickened the patina on bronze statues, but hasn’t affected their shapes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Statue of Liberty ->","completion":" Even if the Statue of Liberty ends up at the bottom of the harbor, Appelbaum says, its form will remain intact indefinitely, albeit somewhat chemically altered and possibly encased in barnacles. That might be the safest place for it.\n"}
{"prompt":"St. Paul’s Chapel ->","completion":" At some point thousands of years hence, any stone walls still standing—maybe chunks of St. Paul’s Chapel across from the World Trade Center, built in 1766 from Manhattan’s own hard schist—must finally fall. Three times in the past 100,000 years, glaciers have scraped New York clean. Unless humankind’s Faustian affair with carbon fuels ends up tipping the atmosphere past the point of no return, and runaway global warming transfigures Earth into Venus, at some unknown date glaciers will do so again.\n"}
{"prompt":"Fresh Kills, Staten Island ->","completion":" The four giant mounds of entombed garbage at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island will be flattened, their vast accumulation of stubborn PVC plastic and of one of the most durable human creations of all—glass—ground to powder. After the ice recedes, buried in the moraine and eventually in geologic layers below will be an unnatural concentration of a reddish metal, which briefly had assumed the form of wiring and plumbing. Then it was hauled to the dump and returned to the Earth. The next toolmaker to arrive or evolve on this planet might discover and use it, but by then there would be nothing to indicate that it was us who put it there.\n"}
{"prompt":"British Isles ->","completion":" The British Isles would be somewhat biologically marooned, as rising seas batter the already-receding chalk cliffs of Dover and widen the 21-mile gap that separates England from France.\n"}
{"prompt":"Europe ->","completion":" Between global warming and ocean-conveyor cooling, if whichever dominates is partly muted by the other, as some models propose, Europe’s meticulous mechanized farmlands would, without humans, fill with brome and fescue grass, lupine, plumed thistle, flowering rapeseed, and wild mustard. Within a few decades oak shoots would sprout from the acidic former fields of wheat, rye, and barley. Boars, hedgehogs, lynx, bison, and beaver would spread, with wolves moving up from Romania and, if Europe is cooler, reindeer coming down from Norway.\n"}
{"prompt":"English Channel Tunnel ->","completion":" Should some impetuous animal attempt the journey via Chunnel— the English Channel Tunnel, Le Tunnel sous la Manche—after human traffic ceases, it might actually make it. Even without maintenance, the Chunnel wouldn’t quickly flood like many of the world’s subways, because it was dug within a single geologic layer, a bed of chalk marl with minimal filtration. Whether an animal would actually try is another matter. All three Chunnel tubes—one each for westbound and eastbound trains, and a parallel central corridor to service them—are swaddled in concrete. For 35 miles there would be no food or water—just pitch darkness. Still, it’s not impossible that some continental species might recolonize Britain that way: The capacity of organisms to ensconce themselves in the world’s most inhospitable places—from lichens on Antarctic glaciers to sea worms in 176°F sea vents—may symbolize the meaning of life itself. Surely, as small, curious creatures like voles or the inevitable Norway rats slither down the Chunnel, some brash young wolf will follow their scent.\n"}
{"prompt":"Khufu pyramid, Egypt ->","completion":" Nor did the proud builders of the ancient world, which had seven wonders, dream that in a span far shorter than eternity only one of them— Egypt’s Khufu pyramid—would remain. Like old-growth forest whose lofty treetops eventually collapse, Khufu has shrunk some 30 feet over the past 4,500 years. At first, that was no gradual loss—its marble shell was cannibalized during the Middle Ages by conquering Arabs to build Cairo. The exposed limestone is now dissolving like any other hill, and in a million more years should not look very pyramidal at all.\n"}
{"prompt":"Great Wall of China ->","completion":" Less ancient, but most imposing of all, is a construction project that spanned 2,000 years, three ruling dynasties, and 4,000 miles, resulting in a rampart so monumental that it achieved the status not just of landmark, but landform. The Great Wall of China is so staggering that it was widely, although erroneously, believed visible from outer space, serving notice even to would-be attackers from other worlds that this property was defended. Yet, like any other ripple in the Earth’s crust, the Great Wall is not immortal, and far less so than most geologic versions. A pastiche of rammed earth, stones, fired brick, timbers, and even glutinous rice used as mortar paste, without human maintenance it is defenseless against tree roots and water—and the highly acidic rain produced by an industrializing Chinese society isn’t helping. Yet without that society, it will steadily melt away until just the stones remain.\n"}
{"prompt":"Panama Canal ->","completion":" This most recent man-made separation has existed for little more than a century—not enough time for any meaningful species evolution, and a canal barely wide enough for two ships to pass each other has hardly been much of a barrier. Still, speculates Bill Huff, until roots work their way into the cracks in the huge, empty concrete boxes that once held ocean-going vessels and finally shatter them, for a few centuries they will be rain-catch holes prowled by panthers and jaguars, as regenerating tapir, white-tailed deer, and anteaters come to drink.\n"}
{"prompt":"500 Fifth Avenue ->","completion":" 500 Fifth Avenue is a 60-story, 697-foot-tall (212 m) office building on the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. In 25 years after people, a summer storms rolls in and on top of the structure is the copper lightning deterrent system that is once protected thousands of office workers. But it has corroded & turned useless and a single lightning bolt strike turn the entire tower into a raging inferno.\n"}
{"prompt":"MetLife Building ->","completion":" In 5 days after people, raw sewage creates methane which seeps into the subways right close to the Grand Central Terminal. It was then revealed in 10 years after people that the tracks are under the MetLife Building making it in the most danger. The methane in the tunnels below the MetLife Building are mixing with other toxic fumes. There are volatile materials like oil and residue on the tracks below, a fair amount of kerosene fumes, gasoline fumes, alcohol fumes, and all the cleaning materials that are used to keep the tunnels dust free and grease free, and all of it are in metal cans which are subject to corrosion. Sitting over the tunnels makes the MetLife Building to absorb a dangerous cocktail of gases. The volatile material in the presence of oxygen begins to oxidize, heats up, and explodes into fire at some point. A ball of flames erupts from below as the large explosion ruptures from the base of the building and shatters the silence of the abandoned New York City. In 60 years after people, the MetLife Building is falling to pieces. The show gave information that when it was opened in 1963, the buildings 56 floors meant it stood as the 7th tallest building in the United States. After people, it will soon give up its place on Park Avenue. It was built in a rather exposed area where it gets more wind and rain than a typical New York City skyscraper. It was already weakened by the methane explosion at its base and 6 decades of neglect have assaulted the buildings steel and glass facade. Sections of the framework peel away a piece at a time. This also means that the Grand Central Terminal is in the line of fire. Sections of the facade of the MetLife Building to fall onto the roof of Grand Central Terminal. In 150 years after people, enduring after a gas fire and shedding steel from its top floors for decades, it finally breaks, causing a collapse to the skyscraper. A giant section then falls southward which tumbles onto the roof of Grand Central Terminal, and despite the attack, the 4 granite walls of Grand Central Terminal still stands.\n"}
{"prompt":"Minetta Street ->","completion":" This is Minetta Street in Greenwich Village. Most New Yorkers might come here and wonder why it curves like this. It curves because once upon a time there was a stream here, and then a brook. There were more than 40 streams on Manhattan island. All flowing down and carrying the rainwater down to the sea. So what happens today, the rain falls,the snow melts, but it flows right along the street and down into that storm drain there. If there weren't people here anymore,there'll be no one here to maintain the sidewalks and maintain the streets. They'd start to crumble up. They'd start to break apart. Trees would come back, vegetation would come back, and eventually the hydrological cycle would reestablish itself. And who knows, maybe Minetta Street might once again become Minetta Brook.\n"}
{"prompt":"New York City ->","completion":" In 150 years after people, the subways that had started to flood in the first 36 hours are flowing subterranean streams and the beams & archways that hold up the roofs are on the verge of collapse. The tunnels not just support the roof of the tunnel but also the street above and in time that the tunnels are inundated with water, corrosion will take hold and it'll start to collapse. The tunnels echo with the sound of cracking steel and cement as the streets of New York City are sucked into the underground. Above ground, life in the city is once again bustling as vines grown up the sides of abandoned skyscrapers which adapt to feed off rainwater that pools in crevices and on ledges. Vines would provide some source of energy for animals in the vertical ecosystem that get birds nesting in, hunting in through, and snakes established. When the insects and smaller animals get established, cats move. While hunting out in the open was hard work, the pickings are easy high above the city where they'll find all that they need to survive without touching the ground and turning them into the kings of the new high altitude food chain with million-dollar views of a bizarrely altered cityscape. The skyscrapers that made New York famous have also transformed into vertical ecosystems. The bottom of the buildings would get rubble, soil accumulation, and sorts of dry environments like oak, hickory, and a wide variety of grasses while the higher areas where there's more wind and drier, the places where plants colonize are going to be cliff dwellers.\n"}
{"prompt":"Brooklyn Bridge ->","completion":" In 100 years, corrosion causes the cables of the Brooklyn Bridge to fail, the decks and railings begin to warp and sway. This cause the deck pulls free and the roadway spills over the East River. The cables tend to shred and fail, and when the individual strains starts to fail in a cascading effect, the whole series of deck will begin to fail.\n"}
{"prompt":"Central Park ->","completion":" In 5 years after people, without armies of gardeners and repairmen, Central Park is untended and is sprouted with saplings. Within 5 years after people, Central Park transform into a forest.All the animals and plants located in Central Park would have a population rise and start spreading out into New York City.\n"}
{"prompt":"Chrysler Building ->","completion":" 200 years after people, the deteriorating columns are the critical point where the skyscraper becomes on verge of total collapse. Several columns buckling in a single floor, allowing one floor to descend rapidly to another level below, is sufficient to trigger a cascading collapse. The Chrysler Building, first of man's skyscrapers to stand taller than 1,000 feet, collapses as the columns gives out the floors. In the process of the collapse, it then destroys some buildings below.\n"}
{"prompt":"Civic Center ->","completion":" Here we are in Foley Square, the administrative center of New York City and location to the famous courthouses you see on TV. This place hasn't always had such colossal buildings and stony streets. Once upon a time, 400 years ago, the collect pond was here, the freshwater source for NYC. Right behind me, there was a stream that drained down to the Hudson River shore, another stream to the East River. And there was this beautiful pond that was nestled in an amphitheater of hills. So what would happen if all the people were to disappear? The buildings, they would tumble down. The soil would start to reform. Trees would start to grow out of them. They would become the new hills, the new amphitheater around this place. Nature would reestablish itself and slowly bring this place back into the green heart of what it means to be here on planet earth.\n"}
{"prompt":"Co-op City ->","completion":" In 100 years after people, water has attacked the structures from above and below. The flat roofs drain to the inside to internal drains and with the water has no place else to go, the drain will leak and invades the insulation underneath. Meanwhile, the sinking land has reverted to tidal mudflats and Co-op City resembles an apocalyptic Venice as it flood. The area of the building in the splash zone where waves are hitting it and when the water level rise and lower with the tide, the splash zone is going to fail. Then a massive winter storm blows in from the northeast. The northeastern would get a fair amount of wave pounding against the building and it would displace the building. Finally, the weakened splash zone buckles under the northeaster's assault and with the forces of water from above and below, the former homes of 55,000 New Yorkers collapse and swallowed by the shifting tides of New York City.\n"}
{"prompt":"Rockefeller Center ->","completion":" In 30 years after people, the walls of the buildings have undergone a transformation. The seams have caught lot of seeds and dirt and in 20 to 30 years, the green grid would start to appear and spread over the buildings. Closer in, the bronze statue of Prometheus have been oxidize by the expose nature of oxygen. In 150 years after people, the Rockefeller Center have been transformed with vegetation, where once a tree that had to be brought in by road to celebrate the holiday season, the greenery is on permanent display. The entire plaza and the buildings surrounding it is covered in greenery.\n"}
{"prompt":"Roosevelt Island Tramway ->","completion":" Holding up the Roosevelt Tramway is a pair of 2inch diameter wire ropes and the weak point is the spot where the cable cross over the steel support towers. The cable is bent back and forth as the tram across it causing fatigue loading in the cables and uses up the life of it. The cables were shifted roughly 100 feet every five years to keep any one point from being in contact with the towers for too long. In 100 years, continually buffeted by the wind causing stress on the wires near the towers, the wires snap and the tram car plunges 250 feet into the East River.\n"}
{"prompt":"Empire State Building ->","completion":" In 200 years after people, the documentary explained the Empire State Building, with sea levels already on the rise and over the centuries, saturated soil around the building foundation pilings have allowed the building to lean. Once a building strays from the vertical, gravity forces will act against the structure which increase the stress at the base of the building. He then continues stating that once it starts to incline, gravitational force cause the top of the building to collapse downward on top of itself. This will cause the Empire State Building to collapse.\n"}
{"prompt":"Statue of Liberty ->","completion":" The Statue of Liberty is holding the second torch since the original was replaced in the 1980s during a massive restoration period. But beneath her copper skin of a few millimeters thick, the skeleton is beginning to disintegrate. The steel straps that hold the copper to the steel framework would pull away, along with the rivets which could pull away over a period of 100 to 200 years. The fate of Statue of Liberty is revealed in 300 years after people when it suffers a fatal relapse of galvanic corrosion, an old complaint. This cause the pieces to fall to the bottom of the New York Harbor, which is now flooded parts of the Liberty Island. The first to fall is the torch bearing right arm which smashed into to the pedestal, then the other parts quickly follow, including the face. The torch bearing right arm would embed itself up to 1\/2 a meter into a mud and the impression may well stay just in a way the footprints are preserved in mud and sand. This concludes the Statue of Liberty as the pieces of the statue is now a shattered symbols of hope turning into the fossils of the future, beneath the ocean floor of Liberty Island.\n"}
{"prompt":"United Nations Headquarters ->","completion":" Meanwhile, the General Assembly Building is outlasted by the 39 story Secretariat Building but just barely because the steel curtain frame is a teetering rusted skeleton. Despite a deep foundation and a heavy duty steel & concrete base, the Secretariat Building was built on filled in land reclaimed from the East River. There are areas of the sub basements are below the level of the waterline and because the lower levels would flood, exposing the steel framework to brackish saltwater. There'll be major motions of water slamming into it continuously. The saltwater itself could cause enough corrosion to bring the building down all at once. After 175 years without people, the Secretariat Tower will collapse and crushing the adjacent Conference Building before slamming into the East River.\n"}
{"prompt":"Grant's Tomb ->","completion":" In 100 years after people, Grant's Tomb is still holding strong but a relentless force is moving to attack: the surrounding trees were revealed to be London planes, so notorious for producing organic debris that New York City officials banned any new plantings of the trees for decades. They shed their bark all throughout the year, and the shed bark and leaves form soil, making it a very fertile area for ivy and other vines to grow. Grant's Tomb has been left unattended before when in beginning in the 1960s, mismanagement by the National Park Service left the monument exposed to damage from water intrusion, plant growth, extensive vandalism, and even used for ritual animal sacrifices which was possibly by Caribbean immigrants who practice a religion called Santeria. Grant's Tomb was viewed as a national disgrace before it was finally restored and rededicated in 1997. After 100 years of unchecked tree growth and creeping vine, it has draped the granite mausoleum like a shroud. In 175 years after people, Grant's Tomb is losing its battle with the trees and despite it was built to last, the destructive London plane have breached the inner sanctum. The area around it is a soil creation machine and once it start to create a lot of soil, it'll create more trees. After 175 years, the relentless soil production and tree growth has covered Grant beneath 6 feet of earth and for the first time in history, there is truly someone buried in Grant's Tomb.\n"}
